8 Queens Problem: Resolved by Genetic Algorithm (python)

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the use of a Genetic Algorithm to solve the classic 8 Queens Problem. The problem involves placing 8 chess queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.

The Genetic Algorithm is an evolutionary algorithm inspired by the process of natural selection. It involves creating a population of candidate solutions, evaluating their fitness, selecting the best candidates, and using them to create new candidate solutions. In this way, the algorithm can explore a large search space and find good solutions.
